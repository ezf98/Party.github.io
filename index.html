          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <p>Here are some of the FAQ that you might have:</p>
          <div>
            <h3>I cannot attend, what do I do?</h3>
            <p>Basically, not come haha. Besides, you could send me a message, so I'm already aware that you will not be partaking in this, and I can be sad about it.</p>
            <h3>Who is invited?</h3>
            <p>Well, you, for example; otherwise check the email I sent, those are the invitees, so please do not invite the whole HR department.</p>
            <h3>Can I arrive later/earlier?</h3>
            <p>Yeah, I don't mind, just let me know, because I'm anxious, although you should already be aware by this point.</p>
            <h3>Do you have [RANDOM ITEM]?</h3>
            <p>If you brought it last time, and it wasn't made of glass, probably, otherwise, no.</p>
          </div>
         <h2>WARNING!</h2>
         <p>I have a <strong><em>dog</em></strong> now, soooooo take it into consideration, in case you are allergic or something</p><br>
